It's a console application created by C++ Programming Languages and uses some OOP properties Like Classes, Constructors, and concepts like abstractions , data-hiding and polymorphism .

At the beginning  you will login to the system or sign up if it's your first time .
There are two types of users  Customers , Admins both with their features.


Customers :

        - Reading from old sessions.

        - Clear their history of reading books.

        - Reading from currently available books.


  Admins :

        - Search about some books if it exist or not .

        - Add new books .


Both of them can view their profiles and update some informations of it.

I have loaded data with load_database() functions to add books , admins ,some users initially to the system.
